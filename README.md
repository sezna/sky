# Sky

Sky is currently a work in progress. It is a programming language that compiles to sheet music and midi. The core abstraction is in the data: primitives are all based on musical primitives, like notes, scales, and chords, as opposed to computational primitives like numbers. See the examples directory to see some example syntax.
